## UNCAPPD

[Live App!](https://joe-uncappd.herokuapp.com/#/)

UNCAPPD is a social media website that focuses on sharing your adventures with Beer with your friends.  It makes use of a Rails/PostgreSQL backend with React.js and Redux on the frontend.

The project was designed and built within a 10 day time-frame.  I do plan on adding additional functionality and improvements over time.

### Features

* Secure frontend to backend user authentication using BCrypt.
* Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete beers.
* Beers are displayed with a picture and buttons that allow for each CRUD action.
* Reviews are displayed in a separate feed.
* Reviews apply the reviewer's username, the beer reviewed, and dynamically assign the star rating given.
